/** Warms the browser's HTTP cache for the sources around the one on screen.
 *
 * This is what makes paging feel instant: by the time you press Next (or
 * Prev) the stamps and light curve are cached and resolve from memory. The
 * cutout stamps are the slow part, rendered on demand from IRSA and STScI.
 *
 * - Starts once the source on screen has its stamps (`ready`), or after
 *   `FALLBACK_MS` if one hangs, so it never competes with them.
 * - Nearest first, one source at a time, so the next source finishes before
 *   anything further out starts.
 * - Every URL is fetched at most once: one that settled is never asked for
 *   again, and one in flight is shared rather than re-requested.
 * - Moving on aborts what is no longer near, but never the source now on
 *   screen -- its `<img>` may be waiting on that same response.
 * - Only immutable responses (stamps, light curve) are warmed: anything else
 *   would be fetched again on arrival anyway.
 *
 * Upstream, `prefetchUrl` marks these as background work, so the API keeps
 * IRSA headroom for the page being read.
